# mechano-NPS-small
programs to extract particle event data from mechano-NPS devices with "small channels", squeeze and sizing widths sub-7 microns, and no recovery segment
This repository can be used to analyze data from mechano-NPS devices. 
Run "test_ver6_nemshort_publish.m" in matlab and it will prompt you to choose a data file to analyze. The program will then allow you to look at each 
particle event to determine whether the program analyzed it correctly. In the end you will get a matrix of all the analyzed events which you can 
copy and paste into excel.
